# Research

We printed out a series of cards that represented pain points and future needs for each team (Groups A, B, C, D). We asked each participants within each table to select 2 cards (out of 4) that speaks to them the most. The other two were just passed along. Next, each participants drew 3 task cards which were used the tasks to be done with the pain point cards.

## Pain Points

The Trenders on the table helped to facilitate as well as capture notes. As this stage went on most of the participants either decided to rewrite the pain point cards to make it more specific, or ignore th task cards and just went ahead describing their pain points. (For example, one task card said to "use three adjectives to describe your pain points, but most people ignored this. One participant in my table just said: I'll just describe it to you guys since we're all here.")

There were 3 blanks cards for pain points that were not in the deck but most participants skipped these, prefering to just describe the one they selected.

After talking about the pain points, each table is to choose the top 3 pain points and use that to create a product to solve the pain points.

Some pain points that all participants resonated with are:

**IPS Blocking/Dropping**

* IPS dropping traffic but don't know the reason; why an IPS block the flow
    * it's difficult to figure out why the IPS dropped a flow
    * Difficult to determine why IPS blocked a flow when the flow is not in blocked streams or event logs

**Better Filter/Rep Metadata entries**

* More data than it is generic entry "mobile app".
    * Helps to push back on creating an exception rule
    * More visibilities into filter logic
         * What was the trigger? Here's the bit that caused it
         * Here's the packet that was captured / network metadata

**Inspecting encrypted traffic/SSL Decryption**

* SSL Decryption/IPS inspection with encrypted traffic
    * Any SSL traffic (50-70%) that can look into the encrypted traffic and make sure it's clean
    * Clinic on campus, someone is farming off our data and it's encrypted, we'll never know
    * Is the techology even there (run a MITM attack)
    * Content based exclusions (don't intercept finance, health, etc...)

**Configure multiple servers for all types of AAA**

* AAA (Authorization, Authentication, Accounting)
    * Sony has multiple branches that have different domain controllers
    * Alabama Powers has 10 Domain Controllers

## Future Needs

The future needs cards were related to:

* Moving to the Cloud infrastructure
* IoT
* SOAR and SOC (Security Orchestratio Automation Remediation)
* Intelligence-enabled SOC
* API driven

There were three blank future cards. All participants skipped this part as well. Some feedback were the future needs were not focused and not related to SMS. And the future needs were valued differently for each participants so the participants don't know they actually will have a use for it.

Some comments were:

> IoT is already here. It is not a future needs.
> > Brad (Sony)

> I have to worry about it because I'm in a University. We have to worry about compliance in HIPPA, PCI, PHI...
> > Francisico (Nova Southern Univerity) when talking about IoT

> In terms of responsibilities: who are responsibles? Are the vendors (Sony) responsible? Are the end users responsible? We need to have more regulation around these devices
> > Brad (Sony), Pete (Northeast Georgia Health System), Francisco (NSU)

> I am interested in moving to the Cloud infrastructure as a future needs. An IPS for Cloud Network Security solution. The edge of the network is gone.
> > Pete (Northeast Georgia Health System)
