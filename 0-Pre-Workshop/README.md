We had couple meetings to plan the logistics of the the 2018 UX Workshop, with the intention of understanding everyone's role and what to expect during the workshop in Nov.  12th 2018 at Austin.

Materials that help set the agenda and focus of the workshop for the participants and Trenders. The materials may evolve during the workshop so they are “WIP”.
