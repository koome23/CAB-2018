# Post-Workshop Feedack

After the sharing the team gathered to debrief. Pacha shared the [Summary for CAB 2018 Workshop] slides for the team. Afterward, everyone shared feedback and how they felt coming out of the workshop.

* Kahoot game is good
* Set expectations at the beginning of workshop, no promises, etc.
* Set specific scenarios, for example, is the innovation for power users or others?
* “Task” card, people don’t really follow
* Some customers like 2017 CAB (more focused) better; others like 2018 one better (more open/game)
* 2 separate roles, Facilitator and Note Taker
* Good to have 1 team share the learning/conclusion with other teams, etc.
* Using a Chime/Bell, etc. for team reminders
* Small community to share and to learn others’ pains, etc.
* Planning shall be done much earlier, etc.
